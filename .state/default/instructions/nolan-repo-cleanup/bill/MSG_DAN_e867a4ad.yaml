phase: Planning
task: |
  Based on research.md findings, create a phased implementation plan for repository cleanup. Prioritize: 1) Immediate cleanup (obsolete items, stale projects, loose files), 2) Log rotation for cronos, 3) State consolidation approach (SQLite vs file-based), 4) Agent directory strategy (runtime generation vs repo storage), 5) Production/multi-user preparation. Include specific files/folders to delete, move, or archive. Consider implementation order and dependencies.
