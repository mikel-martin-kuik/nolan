project: nolan-repo-cleanup
project_path: /home/mmartin/Proyectos/nolan/projects/nolan-repo-cleanup
agent: carl
phase: Implementation
task: |
  Execute plan.md Phases 1-2 only (approved by review). CORRECTIONS from plan-review.md: 1) Remove agent-ralph-nova from Task 1.1 - only delete agent-ralph-echo and agent-ralph-ziggy (nova doesn't exist). 2) Note that mailbox/ and experimental agents are untracked - git restore won't work for rollback. SCOPE: Phase 1 (immediate cleanup: delete obsolete dirs, move roadmap files to docs/, archive stale projects, clean old cronos logs) and Phase 2 (log rotation script). Do NOT implement Phases 3-5 - those require further investigation.
